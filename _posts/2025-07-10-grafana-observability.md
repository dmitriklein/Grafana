## 🚀 Launch Grafana

I strongly endorse the use of the Grafana: 

- Infinity plugin and data source.
  They function exceptionally well for generating small-scale local and remote (http) data collections.
  As a result, the Infinity data source can be effortlessly integrated into Grafana visualizations’ drop-down lists. 

- custom variables and business variables.
  They function exceptionally well in drop-down lists and menus integrated within panels/visualizations. 

- chained variables.
  They function exceptionally well for smart data selecting from Elastic and Splunk mixed data sources.

## 🎯 Overview

Grafana is more than a dashboard builder — it's the core of many observability stacks. 
By connecting it with time-series databases like Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics, or TimescaleDB, teams gain real-time insight into infrastructure performance, app health, and more.

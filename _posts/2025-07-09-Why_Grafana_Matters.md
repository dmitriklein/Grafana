I strongly endorse the use of the Grafana:
- custom variables and business variables. They function exceptionally well in drop-down lists and menus integrated within panels/visualizations.
- chained variables. They function exceptionally well for smart data selecting from Elastic and Splunk mixed data sources.
- Infinity plugin and data source. They function exceptionally well for generating small-scale local and remote (http) data collections. As a result, the Infinity data source can be effortlessly integrated into Grafana visualizationsâ€™ drop-down lists.

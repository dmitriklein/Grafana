# Grafana
My own Grafana software solutions, technologies, plugins, features, etc. developed.


I strongly endorse the use of the Grafana custom variables and business variables! They function exceptionally well in drop-down lists and menus integrated within panels/visualizations. 

I strongly endorse the use of the Grafana chained variables! They function exceptionally well for smart data selecting from Elastic and Splunk mixed data sources. 

I strongly endorse the use of the Grafana Infinity plugin and data source! They function exceptionally well for generating small-scale local and remote (http) data collections. As a result, the Infinity data source can be effortlessly integrated into Grafana visualizationsâ€™ drop-down lists. 

Details will be given later...
